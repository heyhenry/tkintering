Not liking the way the app is operating at the moment. Need it to be more similar to the window default calc app. 

The way the numbers are taken in and the result is displayed automatically should be similar to the windows default calculator app. (might be a good idea to add the little input display text they got going on the default windows calc app as well for better readability)
